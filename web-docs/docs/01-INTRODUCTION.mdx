## Description

A basic starting project (template) for Java applications developed on the Ewon JTK using Maven.

This project is intended to replace the functionality provided by the Ewon JTK's `build.xml` Ant
build file for projects, and improve upon the development experience by providing a more modern
build system and project structure.

## Getting Started

To get started, please refer to the [Quick Start Guide](03-QUICK_START_GUIDE.mdx). This guide
provides instructions for using the template, configuring the Maven POM file, and configuring the
Docusaurus documentation.

Additional information about the template, Maven POM file, and Docusaurus documentation can be found
on the various pages under the 'Setup' section of the website menu.
