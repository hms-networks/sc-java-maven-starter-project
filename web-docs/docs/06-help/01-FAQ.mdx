## 1. How do I import template changes into my project?

When a new version of the template is released, you can import the changes, or a selection of the
changes, in to your project.

This can be completed by configuring the template as a remote repository, and then pulling the
changes from the template into your project. Depending on the changes you want to import, you may
need to resolve merge conflicts.

Detailed information on how to configure the template as a remote repository can be found in the
GitHub
documentation, [Configuring a remote for a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork).

Detailed information on how to pull changes from the template into your project can be found in the
GitHub
documentation, [Syncing a fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/syncing-a-fork#syncing-a-fork-branch-from-the-command-line).

- Please note that while GitHub templates are similar to a normal fork of the repository, the option
to 'sync' may be unavailable on the GitHub website and CLI. Repositories created from a template do
not contain the full upstream history, and therefore cannot be synced in the same way as a normal
fork. 
- Instead, you will need to follow the steps outlined to merge the changes from the template
into your project.
